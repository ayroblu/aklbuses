AT Data
=======

Hi, I'm just trying to visualise some Auckland Transport data

TODO
----
* watchify + browserify!
* Icons (circles...) with bus numbers
* Setup mysql database
* Setup websocket connection
* Upon finish send request for data back to server (basically a bounds)
* Server responds with chunked data - stick in a stop loop thing when new data
* Every 30 seconds clients make a request for more data, and server responds - remember to clear old data - animation
    * Check for what exists, added or removed


Also TODO
---------
* Display routes - can do this if click on a bus
* Directional arrows
